# Version 1.0

This is a self-made Wordpress framework for use at the Office of Student Involvement at UCF.  We use it as a base for the Wordpress themes we build for OSI Agencies as well as OSI itself.

**Heads Up**:  If you aren't a part of OSI, but you'd like to use this code base, feel free!  Just remember to remove the various logos from the footer.
